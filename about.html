    <h1>About Rizara Meats</h1>
    <p>
      Rizara Meats is building a trusted halal meat supply ecosystem that connects
      Kenyan farmers to local and international markets through ethical sourcing,
      quality processing, and full traceability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- COMPANY STORY -->
  <section class="container mt-12">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Rizara Meats was founded to solve a growing gap between livestock producers
      and reliable meat markets. While demand for halal meat continues to rise
      across Kenya and the GCC region, many farmers lack access to structured
      buyers, fair pricing, and export-ready supply chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      By aggregating livestock, enforcing quality standards, and coordinating
      processing and logistics, Rizara creates value for farmers while delivering
      consistent, high-quality halal meat to buyers.
